# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.15.0] - 2025-04-28

### Added
- Added support for generating EOF signals on named pipes when exporting empty span batches
- Implemented "pipe touch" operation (open and immediately close the pipe) when export is called with empty spans

### Fixed
- Fixed issue where downstream extensions would hang waiting for EOF when no spans were sampled
- Resolved edge case where named pipes wouldn't receive EOF signals during empty span flushes

### Changed
- Version bump to align with other packages in the monorepo

## [0.13.0] - 2025-04-14

### Added
- Added `LogLevel` enum with `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, and `ERROR` variants
- Added optional `level` field in the output for easier filtering in log aggregation systems
- Added `OTLP_STDOUT_SPAN_EXPORTER_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to set the log level
- Added support for named pipe output as an alternative to stdout
- Added `OutputType` enum with `STDOUT` and `PIPE` variants
- Added `OTLP_STDOUT_SPAN_EXPORTER_OUTPUT_TYPE` environment variable to control output type ("pipe" or "stdout")
- Added `Output` abstract class with implementations for stdout and named pipe
- Added comprehensive tests for log level and named pipe output features

### Changed
- Named pipe output uses a fixed path at `/tmp/otlp-stdout-span-exporter.pipe` for consistency
- Improved error handling with fallback to stdout when pipe is unavailable
- Optimized pipe existence check to happen only once during initialization

## [0.11.0] - 2025-03-18

### Added
- New constants module that exports `EnvVars`, `Defaults`, and `ResourceAttributes` classes
- Improved documentation for configuration precedence rules
- Added type hints for all constants

### Changed
- Environment variables now always take precedence over constructor parameters
- Improved error handling for invalid configuration values
- Enhanced input validation for environment variables
- Updated README to document the new constants module and precedence rules
